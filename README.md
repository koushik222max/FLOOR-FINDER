# âš¡ðŸ”» FLOOR IT DOWN â€” PYTHONâ€™S HIDDEN GRAVITY 

## ðŸŽ­ Hook  
Every number wants to floatâ€¦  
But sometimes, gravity drags it **down to its lowest whole self**.  



## ðŸ“œ Body  
This Python script demonstrates the magic of **`math.floor()`**:  

- Takes a decimal number.  
- Strips away the fraction.  
- Returns the **largest integer less than or equal** to the number.  
---
âœ¨ Example:  
7.4 â†’ 7  


## ðŸš€ CTA  
- Clone it.  
- Run it.  
- Let your numbers **fall gracefully** into their truest form.  
- Because in Python, even numbers need a **floor to stand on**.
